# HumanRT
SAT based data collected from humans in the presense of noise, blur and color.

## About
Data collected on human reaction time on an object recognition task with increasing
difficulty by having a rigid time regime and pertubations.

## Process
 We collect performance statistics from 33 observers (22 Male, 11 Female) with ages ranged from 24 to 62 years, and who who agreed to participate in an hour long session. Each observer had a normal or corrected-to-normal vision. The stimuli were presented via JATOS survey via worker links to each observer. A standard IRB approved consent form was signed before collecting the data by each observer, and demographic information was collected. For different perturbations, observers were given specific instructions to complete the survey. 

Prior to the study, subjects were instructed that image categories were linked to key presses of their letters (A)irplane, a(U)tomobile, (B)ird, (C)at, d(E)er, (D)og, (F)rog, (H)orse, (S)hip and (T)ruck. They also has a training run of 20 images where they learned the key-class labels and were given feedback on the speed of their responses.

Stimuli images were scaled to 190x190 pixels for optimal viewing.The survey was designed on five fixed viewing conditions (blocks) of 200 ms, 400 ms, 600 ms, 800 ms, and 1000 ms with a tolerance of 100 ms. Outside of these tolerance values, trials were discarded.

For noise and blur surveys, each time condition block consisted of 300 trials (1500 trials in total) while the color survey had 100 trials (500 trials in total). At the end of the time-limit for a trial, a beep sounded within 60 ms of which the observer had to enter their category decision via key-press after which feedback was given: if they were quick, slow or perfect while pressing the key.
